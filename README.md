# RIP and NAT Implementation in Cisco Routers

## Objective
This guide demonstrates the configuration of **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)** for dynamic routing and **Network Address Translation (NAT)** for address translation in a Cisco router environment.

## Prerequisites
- Cisco Router with IOS
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts
- Access to Cisco CLI

## Procedure

### 1. Implementing RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

1. **Enable RIP on the router:**
   ```bash
   Router> enable
   Router# configure terminal
   Router(config)# router rip


2. **Specify the network(s) you want to advertise:**

   ```bash
   Router(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0
   Router(config-router)# network 192.168.2.0
   ```

3. **Enable RIP version 2 for classless routing:**

   ```bash
   Router(config-router)# version 2
   ```

4. **Verify RIP routing tables:**

   ```bash
   Router# show ip route
   ```

### 2. Implementing NAT (Network Address Translation)

1. **Configure NAT inside and outside interfaces:**

   * Inside interface (private network):

     ```bash
     Router(config)# interface FastEthernet0/0
     Router(config-if)# ip nat inside
     ```
   * Outside interface (public network):

     ```bash
     Router(config)# interface FastEthernet0/1
     Router(config-if)# ip nat outside
     ```

2. **Create an access list for private IP addresses:**

   ```bash
   Router(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
   ```

3. **Configure NAT to use Port Address Translation (PAT):**

   ```bash
   Router(config)# ip nat inside source list 1 interface FastEthernet0/1 overload
   ```

4. **Verify NAT translations:**

   ```bash
   Router# show ip nat translations
   ```

## Discussion

* **RIP**: A distance-vector protocol that allows routers to dynamically exchange routing information. It uses hop count as the metric for path selection.
* **NAT**: Allows private IP addresses in an internal network to share a single public IP address for internet communication, enhancing security and reducing the need for public IP addresses.
 
## Conclusion

By implementing RIP and NAT, this configuration helps in dynamically routing traffic between networks and efficiently managing the use of public IP addresses.
